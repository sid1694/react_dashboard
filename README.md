This interactive, web-based dashboard is designed to streamline the monitoring and management of Jenkins builds and system metrics like disk usage and active users. It provides a clear, real-time view of system operations, making it an essential tool for IT professionals and system administrators.

## Features

- **Build Monitoring**: Integrates with Jenkins to provide insights into build statuses with a detailed pie chart representation.
- **Export Tracking**: Lists recent file exports with details like file size and export date, helping users track system outputs efficiently.
